# *bonsaiERP*

*bonsaiERP* is a simple ERP multitenant system written with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and includes the following modules:

- Sales
- Buys
- Expenses
- Bank and Cash Accounts
- Inventory
- Multi currency
- Multiple companies
- File management (in development)

The system allows to use multiple currencies and make exchange rates.

## Installation

### bonsaiERP requires

- Ruby 2.2.2
- PostgreSQL 9.4 and postgresql-contrib to enable **hstore**
- Nodejs for compiling assets
- imagemagick
- phantomjs

### Installing *bonsaiERP*

After installing the required (ruby, postgresql, etc.) you can begin with *bonsaiERP*, run

`rake db:migrate`

this will create all neccessary tables, if you are in ubuntu
or debian edit yor `/etc/hosts` file and add something like this

```
127.0.0.1	app.localhost.bom
127.0.0.1	bonsai.localhost.bom
127.0.0.1	mycompany.localhost.bom

```
in development you will need to edit but in production you can configure
so you won't need to edit the `/etc/hosts` file for each new subdomain, start the app `rails s` and go to
http://app.localhost.bom:3000/sign_up to create a new account,
to capture the email with the registration code use [mailcatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/). Fill all registration fields
and then check the email that has been sent, open the url changing the port and you can finish creation of a new company.

> The system generates automatically the subdomain for your company name
> with the following function `name.to_s.downcase.gsub(/[^A-Za-z]/, '')[0...15]`
> this is why you should have the subdomain in `/etc/hosts`


### Attached files (UPLOADS)

*bonsaiERP* uses dragonfly gem to manage file uploads, you can set where
the files will go setting:

`config/initialiazers/dragonfly.rb`
